In this lesson, we learned about:

- Machine learning, supervised machine learning, and classification.
- Machine learning workflow and how to establish one using scikit-learn.
- Prototyping a binary classifier using scikit-learn.
- Limitations of experimentation in machine learning without understanding some of the fundamentals first.

In the next lesson, we'll learn about the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and implement it from scratch.
