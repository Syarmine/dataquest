## Fine-tuning the model

Our model got an accuracy score of approximately 82.56. That means roughly 82.56% of our predictions were correct.

That's a pretty good result, but building machine learning models is an iterative process. We can try to improve upon our result.

When we instantiated the LinearSVC model, we defined the following parameters:

- penalty="l2"
- loss="squared_hinge"
- C=10

While we don't know what these values imply for our model, we can experiment with them.

In an attempt to improve upon our result, we will:

- Change the values to one of the above parameters.
- Add and set another parameter from the documentation.

### Instructions
1. Create an instance of LinearSVC and assign it to model. Pass the following parameters when instantiating:
    - penalty="l2"
    - loss="squared_hinge"
    - C=20
    - max_iter=3500
    - random_state=417
        - This ensures that the result is reproducible.
2. Call model.fit() and pass the following parameters to the function:
    - X_train
    - y_train
